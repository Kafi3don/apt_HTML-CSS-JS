<h2>AptLearn On Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes give more description to the contents of an element.They are functions found within the opening tags of elements. 
    Attributes give more information about and can be used to style an element. Attributes work along with the attribute <b>VALUES</b> .
    There is/are attribute(s) for every tag in HTML, yes! <strong>EVERY</strong>, name it.</p>
<p>Examples of attributes are <strong> scr, alt, href, width, height, title, style, type, start, etc.</strong></p>

<h4>The src and alt attributes used alongside the width and height attributes in the &#x227Aimg&#X227B tag</h4>
<img src="thatpic.jpg" alt="a random picture" width="650" height="350">

<h4>The Style attribute </h4>
<h3 style="color:limegreen"> The style attribute and color value is what I used to colour this text.</h3>

<h4>The <b>href</b> attribute is used within the &#X227A a&#X227B tag and is used to create a link <br>
to another webpage, website or any material of reference on the WWW. I used it below</h4>
<p>Be like me and <a href="https://aptlearn.io">LEARN EVERYTHING ABOUT CODING</a>. I promise it'll be worth your while.</p>
<p>I will use the <strong>href</strong> attribute agian below but this time it'll be with a <b>RELATIVE URL</b> against the <b>ABSOLUTE URL</b> I previously used.</p>

<p>Here it goes; I WILL BE USING THE <b>TYPE and START</b> ATTRIBUTES IN MY <a href="lists.html"><b>LESSON ON LISTS</b></a> WHICH IS SIMPLY ANOTHER FILE OR PAGE OF MY PROGRAM </p>
